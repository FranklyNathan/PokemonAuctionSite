A quick patch addressing the bugs we've found while grinding this weekend:

-Rare Candies now no longer cause a Pokémon not to attempt to learn a move if it would also evolve the same level.
-Fixed a typo in Night Lycanroc's learnset prevent it from learning Counter
-Gastly starts with Hypnosis instead of Spite (rearranged order)
-Gengarite is now for sale in Ever Grande (I'd forgotten to add it)
-Goodra Hisui learns Iron Head (Instead of just Sliggoo)

Special Events:
-Buyer's Remorse is now mandatory
-Trade Time now allows for one Pokémon to have trade protection.
