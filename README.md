# Auction-Draft
A web app to run a multi-user auction style fantasy draft with realtime updates to all connected clients. Built on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects, vanilla JS and HTML with Shoelace components.

Cloned from https://github.com/snisher/Auction-Draft

## Usage
Step one is setting up the auction. You'll need a CSV file of all the available players available to draft. This version has been adapted for draft races of Pokemon Emerald Blitz.

## Design
See design.md for ramblings on the design.
